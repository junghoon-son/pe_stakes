He also paid kickbacks and bribes to purported telemedicine companies to obtain signed prescriptions from physicians who had no relationship with the patients, rarely spoke to them, and made no determination of the medical necessity of the prescriptions. Through his pharmacy network, Lacerda caused false and fraudulent claims for the medications to be submitted to Medicare Part D plans.

In executing the scheme, Thigpen paid kickbacks to several purported marketing entities in exchange for the referral of doctors' orders for definitive urine drug testing and genetic testing that Thigpen knew to be medically unnecessary.

Wilson, a nurse practitioner and purported telemedicine company owner, is alleged to have committed an over $137 million scheme (including over $81 million in newly alleged loss in the superseding indictment) in which she owned and controlled two telemedicine companies, Advantage Choice Care, LLC and Tele Medcare, LLC, that solicited illegal kickbacks and bribes in exchange for medically unnecessary orders for orthotic braces and prescriptions for pain creams. Wilson conspired to launder the proceeds of the funds through shell companies and by hiding cashiers' checks. She also engaged in income tax evasion by not filing returns and filing of false returns and by hiding and concealing her income earned in part through the scheme. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Darren Halverson and Kelly Lyons of the Newark Strike Force.",

From 2019 through 2022, Spiegel, a laboratory representative, paid kickbacks and bribes in exchange for doctors' orders for medically unnecessary genetic testing. Spiegel also took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and national emergency by soliciting genetic samples from Medicare beneficiaries who were seeking only COVID-19 tests in their homes and at COVID-19 testing events at retirement communities, senior centers, and assisted living facilities. Spiegel used these genetic samples to cause Medicare to be billed for genetic tests that were medically unnecessary, ineligible for reimbursement, not provided as represented, and/or procured through kickbacks and bribes.

        "summary": "Colby Edward Joyner, 34, of Monroe, North Carolina, was charged by indictment for his role in a telemedicine fraud scheme. Joyner, a physician assistant, is alleged to have prescribed medically unnecessary cancer genetic and pharmacogenetic testing for hundreds of North Carolina Medicare beneficiaries. From in or around October 2018 through in or around August 2019, Joyner prescribed genetic testing for Medicare beneficiaries he had never met, seen, or treated, and with whom he may have had only a brief telephone conversation, or no interaction with whatsoever. In connection with these prescriptions, Joyner signed false medical records to conceal that he was not the treating physician, that he did not conduct medical evaluations or examinations, and that the tests were medically unnecessary. As part of the alleged scheme, Joyner caused the submission of false claims to the Medicare program in an amount exceeding $10 million, for which Medicare paid approximately $3.6 million. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Katherine Armstrong and Matthew Warren of the Western District of North Carolina.",
